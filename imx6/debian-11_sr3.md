## Download

- [i.MX6, microSD bootable](https://images.solid-run.com/IMX6/Debian/sr-imx6-debian-bullseye-20230809-cli-sdhc.img.xz)

# Documentation

## Install

All images are designed for raw deployment byte by byte (**not as a file**) to block storage such as microSD cards. Several tools can be used, including `dd`, `win32diskimager` and [etcher.io](https://etcher.io/). Note that care must be taken to decompress the image file for the first 2, while *etcher.io* can also handle the compressed image.

## Log In

Once greeted by a login prompt, the default username and password are both "debian". For security reasons there is **no** root password! If you really need one, you can run `sudo passwd root` to set your own.
For remote sessions, ssh is preconfigured. Check your router for finding the devcies IP address, or try the default hostname *sr-imx6*.

## Usage Hints

### Install to eMMC

If you have the optional eMMC on your SOM use these instructions to install Debian on the eMMC and boot from there.

1. Set the [boot select jumpers](https://solidrun.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/developer/pages/286621835/HummingBoard+Edge+Gate+Boot+Jumpers) to SD card

2. Boot from SD

3. Download the Debian image

4. As root write the downloaded image to the eMMC:

       xz -dc sr-imx6-debian-bullseye-20210904-cli-sdhc.img.xz | dd of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=4M conv=fsync

5. Find bootloader images:

  - if running Debian 11 already, binaries are installed in */usr/lib/u-boot/mx6cuboxi/*:

        cp -v /usr/lib/u-boot/mx6cuboxi/{SPL,u-boot.img} ./

  - otherwise these binaries are part of the image that was just written to eMMC, which can be mounted for access:

        mount -o ro /dev/mmcblk2 /mnt
        cp -v /mnt/usr/lib/u-boot/mx6cuboxi/{SPL,u-boot.img} ./
        umount /mnt

  - finally binaries of the SolidRun u-boot fork are available for download:

        wget -O SPL https://images.solid-run.com/IMX6/U-Boot/spl-imx6-sdhc.bin
        wget -O u-boot.img https://images.solid-run.com/IMX6/U-Boot/u-boot-imx6-sdhc.img

6. As root write the bootloader images to the eMMC:

       dd if=SPL of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=1K seek=1 conv=fdatasync
       dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=1K seek=69 conv=fdatasync

7. Shut the system down with the `poweroff` command

8. Disconnect power source

9. Set the boot select jumpers to eMMC boot

10. Boot the system from eMMC

### Wayland

While it is possible to install full destop environmnts such as Gnome, for testing functionality the reference compositor weston should be used:

      # install weston
      sudo apt install weston

      # start weston FROM A PHYSICAL TERMINAL not remote or serial session
      weston-launch -- --backend=drm-backend.so
      # by default one application is available, the terminal emulator, at the upper left corner.

### X11

X11 is only partially functional:
- the cursor is invisible with *twm*
- video playback crashes X server, because the XV extension uses an unsupported glsl version

Install:

      sudo apt install twm xinit xserver-xorg xserver-xorg-input-evdev xterm

Configure:

      cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/etnaviv.conf
      Section "Device"
        Identifier "etnaviv"
        Driver "modesetting"
        Option "kmsdev" "/dev/dri/card1"
        Option "AccelMethod" "glamor"
        Option "HWcursor" "False"
      EndSection

      Section "ServerFlags"
        Option "AutoAddGPU" "false"
      EndSection
      EOF

      # configure application startup
      cat > .xinitrc << EOF
      twm &
      xterm
      EOF

Run:

      # start X server FROM A PHYSICAL TERMINAL not remote or serial session
      startx

### OpenGL-ES

- X11:

  Due to a combined problem with xf86-video-modesetting, the implementation of the XV extension in glamor and mesa, accelerated video playback does not currently work on X.

### MIPI-CSI2 Video Capture

This section provides an example for how a common TC358743 HDMI capture card would be used with the CSI-2 port on a HummingBoard Base or Pro.
The instructions below are incomplete, because during testing the author was not able to actually capture a frame. Likely this has been due to the particular capture card used, and problems in how it has been wired.

i.MX6 SoCs support complex configuration of video capture using a number of processing elements, including scaling, colour conversions and overlay from multiple sources. For details, refer to the official [documentation for the i.MX Video Capture Driver](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/media/imx.html)!
Below are example configuration steps for unprocessed capture the sensor:

```
# configure pipeline
media-ctl -l "'tc358743 0-000f':0->'imx6-mipi-csi2':0[1]"
media-ctl -l "'imx6-mipi-csi2':1->'ipu1_csi0_mux':0[1]"
media-ctl -l "'ipu1_csi0_mux':2->'ipu1_csi0':0[1]"
media-ctl -l "'ipu1_csi0':2->'ipu1_csi0 capture':0[1]"
```

The HDMI Capture Card requires loading EDID data, to allow negotiation of timings with the source. An example file supporting 720p is available from the pikvm project: [tc358743-edid.hex](https://github.com/pikvm/kvmd/raw/master/configs/kvmd/tc358743-edid.hex)
It can be loaded by th following steps:

```
# find sensor v4l sub-device device node
media-ctl -p -e 'tc358743 0-000f'
- entity 61: tc358743 0-000f (1 pad, 1 link)
             type V4L2 subdev subtype Unknown flags 0
             device node name /dev/v4l-subdev7

# load edid
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/v4l-subdev7 --set-edid=file=tc358743-edid.hex
```

The negotiated timings are not applied automatically. On first use, and any time a different source is connected, this has to be re-run!

```
# view and apply negotiated timings:
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/v4l-subdev7 --query-dv-timings
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/v4l-subdev7 --set-dv-bt-timings query
```

Picture format is not currently propagated through the capture pipeline. Below steps configure a default for 720p UYVY:

```
# view current configuration:
media-ctl -p -e 'tc358743 0-000f'
media-ctl -p -e 'imx6-mipi-csi2'
media-ctl -p -e 'ipu1_csi0_mux'
media-ctl -p -e 'ipu1_csi0'
# configure 1280x720@uyvy
media-ctl --set-v4l2 "'tc358743 0-000f':0[fmt:UYVY/1280x720]"
media-ctl --set-v4l2 "'imx6-mipi-csi2':1[fmt:UYVY2X8/1280x720]"
media-ctl --set-v4l2 "'ipu1_csi0_mux':2[fmt:UYVY/1280x720]"
media-ctl --set-v4l2 "'ipu1_csi0':2[fmt:AYUV32/1280x720]"
```

Now 720p video should be available on the mipi-csi2 receiver block. As a last step, the video format has to be configured for the v4l2 capture device:

```
# find v4l capture device device node
media-ctl -p -e 'ipu1_csi0 capture'
- entity 5: ipu1_csi0 capture (1 pad, 1 link)
            type Node subtype V4L flags 0
            device node name /dev/video4
        pad0: Sink
                <- "ipu1_csi0":2 [ENABLED]

# view current capture format:
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video4 --get-fmt-video
# configure 720p UYVY
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video4 --set-fmt-video width=1280,height=720,pixelformat=UYVY
media-ctl --set-v4l2 "'tc358743 0-000f':0[fmt:UYVY/1280x720]"
# confirm format:
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video4 --get-fmt-video
Format Video Capture:
        Width/Height      : 1280/720
        Pixel Format      : 'UYVY' (UYVY 4:2:2)
        Field             : None
        Bytes per Line    : 2560
        Size Image        : 1843200
        Colorspace        : SMPTE 170M
        Transfer Function : Rec. 709
        YCbCr/HSV Encoding: ITU-R 601
        Quantization      : Limited Range
        Flags             :
```

Congratulations for reading this far! If the step below works for you, we would love to hear about it!

Finally, try to capture one frame:

```
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video4 --stream-mmap --stream-to=frame.raw --stream-count=1
```

### ALSA Examples

    sudo apt-get install vorbis-tools
    wget https://github.com/KDE/amarok/raw/master/data/first_run_jingle.ogg
    # play to 3.5mm jack
    ogg123 -d alsa -o dev:dmix:CARD=Codec first_run_jingle.ogg
    # play to hdmi
    ogg123 -d alsa -o dev:dmix:CARD=DWHDMI first_run_jingle.ogg
    # play to spdif
    ogg123 -d alsa -o dev:dmix:CARD=SPDIF first_run_jingle.ogg

### HummingBoard CBi

#### Initial Setup

HummingBoard CBi can use the CAN-Bus and RS485 only if booted with the appropriate device-tree.
From U-Boot console, interrupt boot by pressing any key during the `Hit any key to stop autoboot` prompt.
Then permanently choose the cbi device-tree variant:

    Hit any key to stop autoboot:  0
    => setenv is_cbi yes
    => saveenv
    => reset

From now on this system is permanently configured as a HummingBoard CBi with i.MX6 DualLite SoM rev. 1.5 or later, and eMMC.
Note that other SoMs need to change the fdtfile accordingly.

Note: U-Boot environment not saving!!!

#### CAN-Bus

After booting with the appropriate device-tree, the CAN network interface will show up in the output of the `ip` utility:

    debian@sr-imx6:~$ ip addr
    ...
    3: can0: <NOARP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 10
        link/can

For transmitting packets it is required to configure a bitrate and set link state up.
Then data can be exchanged e.g. with the `candump` and `cansend` commands from `can-utils` package:

    sudo apt-get install can-utils
    sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000
    sudo ip link set dev can0 up

    # To receive data
    candump can0

    # To send data
    cansend can0 "123#c0ffee"

#### RS485

RS485 does not auto-negotiate.
Instead demo application is available on GitHub for configuring connection properties.
On Debian it can be installed as follows:

    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gcc git libc6-dev linux-libc-dev make
    git clone https://github.com/mniestroj/rs485conf.git
    cd rs485conf
    make
    sudo make install

Then to send a data blob between two devices:

    # On the receiving end:
    sudo rs485conf -e 1 /dev/ttymxc1
    sudo cat /dev/ttymxc1

    # On the sending end:
    printf "Hallo\n" | sudo tee /dev/ttymxc1

Note that `ttymxc1` is the RS485 device on HummingBoard CBi only, other devices will differ.

## Known Issues

### No IP on eth0 when connecting cable after boot

When booting the system without ethernet cable connected, the interface will not acquire an IP address by DHCP when hotplugging the cable later. As a workaround the interface can be cycled down and up:

    ifdown eth0
    ifup eth0
